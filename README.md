# 🛡️ MalariaShield: Predicting Future Malaria Cases for SDG 3

**Goal:** To build a machine learning model that predicts future malaria cases based on historical incidence, reported, and estimated data.

**Why:** This project supports Sustainable Development Goal 3 — "Good Health and Well-being" — by enabling health authorities to plan malaria prevention and response.

## 📁 Data Sources:
- Estimated malaria cases and deaths
- Reported malaria data
- Incidence per 1000 population at risk

## ✅ Tasks:
1. Merge and clean the datasets.

## 🧹 Data Cleaning & Merging

The original datasets were:
- `estimated_numbers.csv`
- `reported_numbers.csv`
- `incidence_per_1000_pop_at_risk.csv`

### Steps Performed:
- Merged datasets on `Country`, `Year`, and `WHO Region`
- Filtered for only African countries (WHO Region: Africa)
- Filled missing values:
  - Replaced missing min/max values with the median
  - Filled missing reported values with `0` (assumed underreporting)
- Final cleaned dataset saved as: `malaria_africa_cleaned.csv`

## 📊 Streamlit Dashboard: MalariaShield

We built a lightweight web dashboard using [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io) to visualize malaria trends and support data-driven decision-making.

### Features:
- **Filter by country and year range**
- **Interactive line and bar charts** for:
  - Estimated vs Reported Malaria Cases
  - Estimated vs Reported Deaths
- **Future predictions** section placeholder for ML model integration
